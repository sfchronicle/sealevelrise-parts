0,sonoma,Sonoma’s changing shoreline,"This edge of the bay began as marshes, was converted into farmland and now is being returned to wetlands. A good example is near Sears Point, where two large restoration projects involving 1,300 acres were done in 1996 and 2015. Ducks Unlimited and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are planning a similar 4,400-acre effort on nearby Skaggs Island (off map).",map_sonoma.png,map_phone_sonoma.png
1,sanleandro,San Leandro Bay,"With as little as 18 inches of sea level rise, water could spill across Doolittle Drive onto the Oakland International Airport several times a year during extra-high tides. The obvious fix: Raise the drive’s low spots. But the road is owned by Caltrans, which means the airport might need to protect itself with inland measures while waiting for Caltrans to take action.",map_sanleandro.png,map_phone_sanleandro.png
2,fostercity,Foster City,"This artificial land mass is protected from the bay by a 12-foot-high levee — a long stretch of which will need to be raised at least 3 feet to escape flood hazard designation. Add another 2 feet, as is now being considered by the City Council, and no additional treatment for hazard protections should be needed until at least 2050. The cost of such a response is estimated to be at least $90 million.",map_fostercity.png,map_phone_fostercity.png
3,ravenswood,Ravenswood Ponds,"An example of the ongoing rebirth of the South Bay Salt Ponds is the next installment of the multidecade effort by the California Coastal Conservancy: 730 acres in Menlo Park. (A) will begin as a mudflat and evolve into a tidal marsh. (B) will remain as a salt flat that provides nesting areas for western snowy plovers. The most accessible area, (C), will be a managed pond.",map_ravenswood.png,map_phone_ravenswood.png
