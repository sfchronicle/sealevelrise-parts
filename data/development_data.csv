0,Treasure Island,"800 apartments, Job Corps campus run by the U.S. Department of Labor.","Up to 8,000 housing units, 25 percent priced at below-market levels, along with a 500-room hotel and 550,000 square feet of retail and offices. Plus a new ferry terminal, perhaps with “Star Wars” creator George Lucas' proposed museum next door.","New soil will be pounded into the existing island to strengthen it during an earthquake and raise the surface several feet. New buildings will be set back at least 300 feet from the shoreline, a defensive move as well as a landscaping gesture.","Site work already is under way at Yerba Buena Island, also part of the project. Treasure Island's groundwork could begin next year."
1,Mission Rock,The last surface parking lot for AT&T Park.,"1,500 housing units, 40 percent of them for low- and middle-income residents, plus office buildings and a waterfront park. The project also includes Pier 48, which would be rehabbed for Anchor Brewing's new home, and a garage for use during Giants games.","The central blocks would be elevated TKTK feet above current levels and reached by sloped roadways on the east, west and south. At Pier 48, a port memo says, “Interior improvements are being evaluated to extend useful life and accommodate some sea level rise.”",The draft environmental impact report should be released by year's end. Voters already have endorsed plans to allow three buildings as tall as 240 feet.
2,Pier 70,"TKTK mostly derelict buildings, though the Noonan Building holds artist studios.","Mixed-use buildings topping off at 90 feet and clustered around a central plaza and set TKTK feet from the current shore.

Two historic buildings now in harm's way would be elevated or moved to safety.,"Developer Forest City is aiming for approvals next summer, after the environmental impact report is released."
3,Candlestick Point,"Everything from the ghost of Candlestick Park and remnants of Hunters Point Naval Shipyard to a hillside where TKTK condominiums have been built, along with 59 recently completed apartments for families at 50 percent of the city's median-income level.","The approved plan allows 12,000 housing units - one-third of them affordable - 6 million square feet of commercial and retail space, and 350 acres of parks. Public benefits would include $50 million for Candlestick Point State Recreation Area.",Extensive waterfront open space would connect the Hunters Point neighborhood to the bay and include marshes to help soften the impact of rising tides.,"The 775-acre project's master plan was approved in 2010, and the first hillside condominiums opened last year. At the former Candlestick Park, a regional shopping center should open in fall 2019."
