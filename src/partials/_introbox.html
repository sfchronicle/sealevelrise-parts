  <p>All credible forecasts indicate that climate change will cause sea levels to rise at an ever-more rapid pace in coming decades, including the waters of San Francisco Bay.</p>

  <p>Chronicle Urban Design Critic John King has explored this challenge through 2016 in all its manifestations, from the perils facing the city’s crumbling Embarcadero to the potential rebirth of the South Bay’s salt marshes and the creation of a small city on man-made Treasure Island.</p>

  <p>The region needs to prepare for these shifting tides. We can protect ourselves and adapt in ways that are enticing as well as scientifically sound. But the Bay Area also must begin planning for that future now – and break the habits of a half-century that inhibit adventurous decision-making and design.</p>
